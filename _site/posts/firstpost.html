<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Hey everyone! Web Components are an incredibly strong piece of technology that are incredibly flexible &amp; powerful. But before we can start building all of these fancy tools, we have to start simply. In this blog post, we&#39;ll go over creating a simple Hello World element.</p>
<p>But even before that, we&#39;ll have to start by installing some required software (Windows).</p>
<h1 id="software-installations">Software Installations</h1>
<p>I used Windows Powershell in order to do this, although practically any terminal works. <a href="https://ohmyz.sh/">https://ohmyz.sh/</a> is a good terminal to use.</p>
<p>In addition, make sure you have a GitHub account. GitHub, along with Git, are great tools that can help aid collaboration and also version control. I&#39;ve had many an experience where I&#39;ve forgotten something that I could find back on GitHub or had to switch back to a previous version to resolve the dreaded merge conflict. </p>
<p>Something that may be a little different is generating a SSH key. SSH stands for Secure Shell Protocol and pretty much just makes sure your computer and GitHub are communicating securely, so malicious actors can&#39;t gain access to our great projects.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s a link for help with setting up your SSH for Git: <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/about-ssh">Click Here!</a></p>
<p>Moving onto more specific software, let&#39;s make sure we have NodeJS and NPM installed. NodeJS will help us run JavaScript and NPM is the default package manager for it. All in all, they&#39;ll combine to give us a comfortable environment to work in.</p>

<p>If you&#39;ve done everything correctly, then they should pop up like this when you check their versions.

<h1 id="hello-world-component">Hello World Component</h1>
<p>Now, as is tradition, let&#39;s start off our Web Component journey by creating a Hello World element.</p>
<p>Start by running </p>
<blockquote>
<p>npm init @open-wc </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then, the helper should ask you what you want to do today. Click <strong>Scaffold A New Project</strong>, then scaffold a <strong>Web Component</strong>. Having done so, the helper should give you three options. We want all three of these options, so hit enter on each one, and then hit enter a final time to move to the next step.</p>
<p>TypeScript is a personal choice, but we skipped it (no) for this tutorial. We can name our new component whatever, but we&#39;ll choose to call it hello-world.</p>
<p>Keep in mind if this is your first time running npm, it can take quite a while for packages to install and audit. But soon enough, it should run and create the whole file structure for you!</p>
<p>If you&#39;ve done everything correctly, it should look something like this.</p>
<p><img src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/z46k7zpd0qq3nie72hzy.png" alt="A Successful Tool Usage Example"></p>
<p>Then, we just need to run </p>
<blockquote>
<p>cd hello-world
npm run start</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And we have our first web component!</p>

<p>Hello World!</p>
